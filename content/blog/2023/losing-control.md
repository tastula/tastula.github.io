Let me tell you a story about a personal tragedy. Or many tragedies, I guess. It
feels like there is so much wrong here.

Earlier this year, I wrote a humorous article for a student magazine. Titled
_Välilehtipsykoosit_ (something like _Tab Psychosis_), it rationalized my habit
of not really closing any tabs, but collecting and organizing them. My tabs are
my workspace. My tabs are my to-do list. With a few tricks, you can have
hundreds of tabs in multiple windows open efficiently. I believe that browsing
history, bookmarks and tabs form a powerful and personal database that can be
used in everyday life. Forget googling for previous stuff; nothing is forgotten
or erased from local storage! All browsers have great tools for managing this
information and with some extensions, it gets even better.

When I first mentioned this "system" in the guild room, people were
flabbergasted. For me, it's almost like journaling. For others, it's clearly
just data hoarding or pure madness (hence the title). People don't understand.
**Tragedy #1.**

In the article, I focused mostly on tabs. They had the greatest potential for
silliness. But to be honest, by far the most important part of the system is
bookmarks. Tabs create flexible work contexts and save resources temporarily.
Bookmarks save knowledge and create shortcuts that last forever.

Except they kinda don't. They really don't.

Today is a calm, boring, dark Sunday. I decided to tidy up my bookmark
collection as one does. Soon I noticed two things. First, my quest for saving
knowledge has become sloppy. I'm not saying my system is flawed or I have too
many bookmarks – of course not – but they're so unorganized it's hard to get the
maximum benefit out of them. No folder structure, no tags, no clean titles.
Second, there's a concerning amount of link rot. Defunct apps, blogs that moved
without redirection, content that was taken down.

I decided to analyze all of my bookmarks for duplicates and broken links with an
extension. I ended up with 9,712 unique bookmarks. I really don't know how much
a normal user has. 9,712 is probably too much? The results of the broken link
analysis are displayed below.

| Code | Error explanation       | Amount |
| ---: | ----------------------- | -----: |
|  401 | Unauthorized            |      2 |
|  402 | Payment Required        |      1 |
|  403 | Forbidden               |     14 |
|  404 | Not Found               |    415 |
|  406 | Not Acceptable          |      1 |
|  408 | Request Timeout         |     57 |
|  410 | Gone                    |     94 |
|  423 | Locked                  |      5 |
|  500 | Internal Server Error   |      4 |
|  502 | Bad Gateway             |      5 |
|  503 | Service Unavailable     |      2 |
|  504 | Gateway Timeout         |      1 |
|  521 | Web Server Is Down      |      1 |
|  526 | Invalid SSL Certificate |      1 |
|  530 | Site Frozen             |     14 |
|    ? | Unknown                 |     57 |

That's 674 bookmarks. Some of them – like the unauthorized requests – are false
positives. Then again, some links are technically working, but lead to wrong
stuff. About 7 % of my bookmarks are useless now. That's way more than I'd like.
How much link rot do I have in my history? I am losing control of the personal
database. **Tragedy #2.**

Whether I liked it or not, this is a wake-up call I get every now and then. If
something is truly great, I should do more than just save it for later. Take
notes or write about it. In private or in public. Actively process the
information once it's there. But it takes so much time and I doubt it's really
worth it after all. **Tragedy #3.**

Maybe I should filter the stuff I find interesting better. Sometimes I feel like
I have no filter at all. Or maybe I should expand the system and start archiving
the websites...
