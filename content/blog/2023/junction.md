Prior to this November, I hadn't attended a hackathon or a startup event like
Slush. I've always kind of wanted to, but never too keenly. My first dip into
the blended world of "p√∂hin√§" and "hacker culture" was at Assembly 2016. It was
also my only one. Then, one fateful October evening, my best friend asked me to
spontaneously form a team with her and try [Junction][junction]. I responded
with a [hell yeah][hellYeah]. We were on our way to hack the uncertainty. üòé

Our team consisted of two developers, one businessperson and one designer.
Nobody knew everyone before the event, but we still worked. We were a team based
on _vibes_. We weren't there to win but to eat free food and have fun on our own
terms. Participation was as non-serious as it can get. Our team was named
Systematic Chaos to reflect that.

Applications for Junction 2023 were written very tongue in cheek. I remembered
mine being cringe, but after revisiting it back home, I actually found it pretty
good. However, it took forever to fill. In addition to the motivational letter,
we needed to provide educational history, themes and industries of interest,
skills, professional roles, recruitment preferences and more.

We got accepted in a few office hours.

Normally I like posting Instagram stories. The ephemerality feels comforting and
a lot of people I care about see my stuff. When Telegram copied the feature and
I tried it out, so many people were angry. They were getting push notifications
of me and seeing me on top of all chats. I don't know why or where, but I got an
idea to act as a hyper excited hacker culture startup enthusiast and post the
whole event on Telegram. I even paid for a month of Telegram Premium just for
this bit. Words can't express the ridiculousness of it. And the hate kept
coming. Some of my friends got the obvious joke, some didn't (still baffling).
My career ended in a bittersweet notes app screenshot announcing our team's
departure.

I cannot stress how hysterical the event was. The whole weekend was so ecstatic.
I was sure we were obnoxious to be around, because we

- took nothing seriously and laughed at every single thing
- ate so much food and snacks oh god we didn't care about personal limits _at
  all_
- brought some Christmas lights and literally shined in every picture
- listened to our own music (first [Mylly py√∂rim√§√§n][mylly] by Kake Randelin and
  then [Losing It][losingIt] by FISHER, on repeat, until it physically hurt)

To everyone's surprise, we made friends with our neighbors and got compliments
for the lights and the music. We also managed to produce something actually
good. We wanted to bring Tamagotchi to the 2020s by taking advantage of existing
hardware. So, our idea was to create a smartphone application that receives
sensor data from a smartwatch, turns it into stats, and visualizes them as a
virtual companion on a watch face. This virtual companion -- almost a digital
twin -- inspires children and teens to exercise and stay active.

The pet was called Nakit. Taking care of Nakit is taking care of yourself. It
really was a promising idea! The pitch deck was gorgeous. The presentation was
informative. The technical demo, well, it is something else. Go [see for
yourself][entry].

The whole experience was truly systematic chaos. Us being there was ironic, but
we genuinely enjoyed it. If my friends are up for it and the organizers let us
in, it's going to be another hell yeah next year.
