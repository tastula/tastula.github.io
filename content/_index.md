## Howdy!

My name is Valtteri. Welcome to my small hand-crafted corner on the internet.

I am a recent **graduate of Tampere University** with a computer science degree.
It only took seven years! Currently I'm working as a
**software specialist** and a CMS certified **scrum master** at [Mylab][mylab].

Since like _forever_ I've been fascinated by the concept of small web, the art
of hosting and blogging as well as projects like [The 512KB Club][512kb] (member
of team Green let's goooo). I've always wanted to take part in them. And now –
even though I suffer from perfectionism – here we are. With the corny footer and
all. Don't judge too hard.

If you want to see me in a bigger corner, try [Instagram][ig]. That's my most
used social media. There's also [GitHub][gh] but it's been pretty quiet there.
