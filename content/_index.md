# Howdy!

My name is Valtteri. This is my small hand-crafted corner on the internet.

I am a **Tampere University graduate** with a master's degree in
computer science. It only took seven years! Currently I'm working as a
**software specialist** and a CMS certified **scrum master** at [Mylab][mylab].

Since like _forever_ I've been fascinated by the concept of small web, the art
of hosting and blogging as well as webrings and clubs. I've always wanted
to take part in them. And now – even though I suffer from perfectionism – here
we are. With the corny footer and all. Don't judge too hard.

If you want to see me in a bigger corner, try [Instagram][ig]. That's my most
used social media. There's also [GitHub][gh] with a stack of unfinished ideas.
