# Howdy!

My name is Valtteri. Welcome to my small hand-crafted corner on the internet.

I am a recent <span class="purple">graduate of Tampere University</span> with a
computer science degree. It only took seven years! Currently I'm working as a
<span class="blue">software specialist</span> and a CMS certified <span
class="gold">scrum master</span> at [Mylab][mylab].

Since like _forever_ I've been fascinated by people with visually and
technologically simple sites, the art of hosting and blogging as well as
projects like [The 512KB Club][512kb] (aspiring member here). Even though I have
perfectionist tendencies, here we are. With the corny footer and all. Don't
judge too hard.

If you want to see me in a bigger corner, try [Instagram][ig]. That's my most
used social media. There's also [GitHub][gh] but it's been pretty quiet there.
