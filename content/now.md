Here's a list of things that are going on now. Right as we speak! ðŸ¤ 

- I'm working as a software specialist and scrum master at Mylab. We're
  developing laboratory information systems for your blood tests.

- The university life is behind me as I moved from Hervanta to Tampere city
  center. My home is finally starting to feel like a home.

- Still having lots of personal projects, both online and offline. Tackling
  laziness is my first goal starting any day now.

- Still listening to Paramore's [This Is Why][tiw]. Following
  [Rollie][climatetown] and [Cody][smn] for the sweet sweet news while trying not
  to get too depressed.

I have experimented with Twitter and Mastodon a few times, but I feel like
Status Cafe and its "current status API" are really neat. I can make something
like this:

{{< statuscafe >}}
