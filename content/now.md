Right now I'm working as a software specialist and scrum master at Mylab. We're
developing laboratory information systems for your blood tests. I'm also trying
to restructure my life now that university is over. Self-improvement and
personal projects, both online and offline. Targeting laziness as my first
goal starting any day now!

Still listening to [This Is Why][tiw1] and some of the [reworks][tiw2].
Following [Rollie][climatetown] and [Cody][smn] for the sweet sweet news.

I have experimented with Twitter and Mastodon a few times, but I feel like
Status Cafe and its "current status API" are really neat. My choice for now for
sure.
